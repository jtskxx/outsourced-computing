# 🏝️ Qubic Outsourced Computing 🏝️

Information about outsourced computing in the Qubic network. 🌊

## 📜 Base Concept

In Qubic, the computational power from AI Trainers (Miners) is divided:

- 🧠 **50%** is used for **Aigarth** (Qubic AI project).
- 🛠️ **50%** is available for **external projects**.

This allows Qubic to support multiple initiatives beyond internal development. 🥥

## 🚀 Monero Proof of Concept (PoC)

To demonstrate how the second 50% can be used, Qubic is running a **Proof of Concept** with **Monero mining**:

- 🪙 Miners will mine **Monero** during their outsourced time.
- 📡 This shows Qubic’s ability to process **external workloads** alongside its own tasks.

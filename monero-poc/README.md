## POC Phases
The POC is junked into 5 Phases.

1. Basic Testing of Messaging ✅
2. Connect Qubic Messaging with Monero (Bridging)✅
3. End-To-End Messaging (including signaling and real monero tasks) ⌛
4. Solution Validation (Oracle) and Revenue Calculation ⏳
5. Go-Live 

## The Principle
For the POC we need high speed delivery of tasks and solutions. We will build on top of the [Qubic Broadcast Message](https://github.com/qubic/core/blob/main/src/network_messages/broadcast_message.h) to achieve this.

Threfore we introduce two new message types:
1. `#define MESSAGE_TYPE_CUSTOM_MINING_TASK 1`
2. `#define MESSAGE_TYPE_CUSTOM_MINING_SOLUTION 2`

1. Custom Mining Task
This type is used by ARB to send out a Task. The interval between tasks is dynamic and may vary from a few seconds up to a few 10s of seconds.

**The Task struct**
```c++
struct
{
    unsigned int sizeAndType;
    unsigned int dejavu;

    unsigned char sourcePublicKey[32];
    unsigned char zero[32];
    unsigned long long taskIndex;
    xmrig::Job job;
    unsigned char signature[64];
} task;
```

1. Custom Mining Solution
After Processing the Task and generating the solution. The solution needs to be sent back to the network.

**The Solution struct**
```c++
struct
{
    unsigned int sizeAndType;
    unsigned int dejavu;

    unsigned char sourcePublicKey[32];
    unsigned char zero[32];
    unsigned long long taskIndex;
    unsigned int nonce;         // xmrig::JobResult.nonce
    unsigned char result[32];   // xmrig::JobResult.result
    unsigned char signature[64];
} solution;
```
>[!CAUTION]
> The Above structs already contain the [RequestResponseHeader](https://github.com/qubic/core/blob/main/src/network_messages/header.h).

### What Monero mining software to be used?
For the POC we gonna try with [XMRig](https://xmrig.com/). If you want to user your own. Feel free to do so.

### How to receive a task?
Connect to the network and listen for the packet type `BROADCAST_MESSAGE (1)`.

Identify a Task:
1. The source must be [DISPATCHER](https://github.com/qubic/core/blob/main/src/public_settings.h#L60)
2. Verify Signature
3. Verify `sizeof(task)`
4. Verify `taskIndex` is higher than previous loaded task

If the above match, use that task and proceed with solution finding.

### How to send back a solution?
If you have found a solution, pack it into the solution struct.

- `sourcePublicKey` must be your computor public key
- `taskIndex` must be the task indes from recevied task
- `nonce` must be the xmrig::JobResult.nonce and equal to a `value` such that `value % 676 == computorIndex`
- `result` must be the result from xmrig::JobResult.result

Sign your solution packet with your computor seed. make the `dejavu = 0` to allow propagation of your solution in the network.
